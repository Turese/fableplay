This rambunctious Fablepet hails from thick forests, where they use their claws to dig into branches to leap across the treetops. They can focus elemental energy into their claws for devastating magic attacks, but most prefer a peaceful life to one of battle. Notably, every Werelapin is allergic to most root vegetables, especially carrots.
